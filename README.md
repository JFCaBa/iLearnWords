After my first Russian lesson I realised that to learn and remember new vocabulary is not going to be an easy task, so I decided to create this simple app because two main reasons.

First one is to help me with the new vocabulary learning, in the way that I can hear it repeatedly and I can do it on my way to work, along the housekeeping, etc.

Second one but not less important is to start coding in Swift.

After 10 years using Objective-C maybe it is now time to move forward and start doing things with Swift (las version when writing this lines is 5.0, and I really like it)
